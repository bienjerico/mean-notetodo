##Desing pattern application:
  - I used Basic MEAN Full Stack Development.

##Libraries:
  - MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS, Bower, Bootstrap and JQuery
    - MongoDB for database with mongoose framework to store my data
    - ExpressJS for NodeJS framework to simplify my codes
    - AngularJS for front-end development, because I don't want my page load so I use data binding
    - NodeJS for server
    - Bower to get all Bootstrap and JQuery components
    - Bootstrap and JQuery for user interface because its easy to use.
